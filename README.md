# Cross Token

**Cross Token** is deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet and serves as a cornerstone of our cross-chain ecosystem. This token is used to cap and prove the total issuance of CROSSx, the native coin of the CROSS chain.

## Overview

Cross Token enables seamless token transfers via a cross-bridge, allowing value to be moved between Ethereum and the CROSS chain. Its primary role is to act as on-chain proof of the issuance of CROSSx, ensuring that the total supply of the native coin on the CROSS chain is strictly limited.

## How It Works

- **Conversion Mechanism**  
  When transferring tokens via the cross-bridge, **1 Cross Token** is exchanged for **100 CROSSx** tokens.

- **Supply Cap**  
  This fixed conversion ratio ensures that the issuance of CROSSx is directly tied to the Cross Token on Ethereum, thereby limiting the total supply of the native coin. This mechanism is critical for maintaining the economic stability and scarcity of CROSSx.

- **Proof on Ethereum**  
  By deploying Cross Token on the Ethereum Mainnet, we leverage Ethereum's robust security and transparency. This provides an immutable on-chain record that verifies the total issuance of CROSSx.

## Benefits

- **Controlled Issuance**  
  The fixed conversion ratio keeps the total issuance of CROSSx within predetermined limits, preventing inflation and preserving the value of the native coin.

- **Transparency and Security**  
  Using the Ethereum blockchain ensures that Cross Token transactions are transparent and secure, instilling trust among users and stakeholders.

- **Seamless Cross-Chain Transfers**  
  The integrated cross-bridge protocol enables smooth and reliable token transfers between Ethereum and the CROSS chain.

## Smart Contract Information

## Technical Details

- **Deployment**  
  The Cross Token smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet.

- **Conversion Ratio**  
  - **1 Cross Token = 100 CROSSx**

- **Mechanism**  
  - Tokens are transferred via the cross-bridge, during which the Cross Tokens on Ethereum are locked, and an equivalent amount of CROSSx is minted on the CROSS chain.
  - This mechanism serves as on-chain proof to cap and verify the total issuance of CROSSx.

## Future Enhancements

We are continuously working to enhance the cross-chain experience. Future improvements may include:

- Advanced cross-chain interoperability features
- Additional security audits and optimizations
- Enhanced user interfaces for managing cross-chain transfers

## Conclusion

Cross Token is a key component of our multi-chain strategy. By linking the issuance of CROSSx to a verifiable asset on Ethereum, we ensure the security, transparency, and economic sustainability of our ecosystem. This design not only protects the value of CROSSx but also reinforces trust and accountability across the entire network.
